database consists of three collections - Recipes, Users and Deleted. When a User creates a recipe, their username and ObjectId is saved as a nested object within that Recipe document under the field \"author\". Using the same logic, when a User deletes a recipe, their ObjectId and Username is logged as a nested object under the field \"deleted_by\" in that Deleted recipe document. When a User saves a recipe as a favourite, the recipe's ObjectId is saved in an array in the recipe document under the field \"favourite_recipes\". The recipe has a field called \"favourite_count\" which increments by one every time a User adds that recipe to their favourite recipe array. When a recipe is deleted, the recipe is deleted from User's favourites as well as the recipe collection and the favourite count is reset to 0. See the schema below:","","The interaction design for this site tries to keep things as simple as possible. The Initial page entitled Intro presents the three main steps for a user in big tempting, clickable buttons - Browse Recipes, Login or Register. The navigational structures from the Navbar are standard and should be familiar with all browser users that collapse to a hamburger menu on smaller devices. It was important to ensure that the user is presented with as many interactive elements as possible when navigating the site. ","","Once the User logs in or registers, they are immediately sent to their favpurite recipes' page (entitled \"My Favourites\"). From there they are encouraged to go to the \"Browse Recipes\" page.","","The main focus of the Recipe Book are the recipes themselves. As with all good UX design, most components advertising the recipes should be interactive and if they are interactive, it should be obvious to the user. This effect is obtained on this website by changing the cursor to a pointer and having buttons hoverable if active.  The recipe name and photo are clickable as well as a button offering to \"View Full Recipe\" and will all take the user to the full recipe view - \"Recipe Display\". The User then has further options to favourite, edit or delete the recipe, all choices displayed on buttons below the photo and vital recipe statitics. ","","Within the User's My Recipes and My Favourites, they are consistenly encouraged to add new recipes or add favourites with buttons that will take them to the add recipe and browse more recipe pages respectively. When a User adds a new recipe, they are immediately returned to the view of that recipe and when they go to browse all recipes, their recipe appears at the top of all the recipes.","","The search function keeps the user informed about the results of their queries. It displays a message reminding the User of their exact search term and informs them of the number of results. If the User's query produces no results, they are encouraged to try one of the site's most popular recipes. This is the way the recipes are rated on the site. ","","I have tried to rely on the 3 Click Rule as much as possible. Each interaction should bring the user to their desired need and if not, they're next navigational choice should be suggested to keep them from becoming frustrated.
